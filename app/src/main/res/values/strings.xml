Along with on field experience, we also organise regular workshops and interaction sessions. These skill development sessions include training in leadership skills, communication skills, public speaking, team effort and planning.</string>
    <string name="iym">This life skill program of LFT is soon going to be launched in our college. We plan to send 10 of our volunteers, every week, to nearby slums and old age homes. Our volunteers would enlighten the children aged 6-12 belonging to lower socio- economic strata on various topics like sanitation, moral sciences, GK, englishspeaking skills etc. We will also be providing them with some basic technical knowledge related to computers. This will help our volunteers to strengthen their skills and also awaken their social consciousness. Thus with the help of these small steps we can contribute to the growth of our nation.</string>
